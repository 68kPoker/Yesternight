# Text-adventure "Yester Night"

This is my text-adventure game written using AdvSys package by David Betz, titled "Yester Night".
Play a role of a doctor that has been sent to a small town where people suffer from unknown
illness. Collect water and food and help suffering people. It will quickly turn out that the 
medicine can only be found by gathering three ingredients. First of them, the "Dwarf's potion" 
is located in the "Cave of Darkness". Second - the "Flower extract" is located in the "Enchanted 
Forest", and the third of them, the "Healing sand" is placed on abandoned pirate's boat somewhere 
near the "Beach of Skeletons".
